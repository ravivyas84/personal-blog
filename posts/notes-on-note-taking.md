Yesterday I had the privilege of being a guest on [Mohammad Najmuzzaman](https://twitter.com/naz_09) channel on Leher where we discussed note-taking. 

Below are the points I had noted down before the conversation. I basically list the software I have tried and what I think about them. 

I mainly talk about: 

- Software I have tried
- Jobs Note-taking does for me
- My Needs
- My Current Stack
- Personal Opinions on Note Taking

## Software I have tried.

- Evernote
    - Best in class OCR and web clipper
    - Great ecosystem
    - Product evolution stalled
- Onenote
    - Image to text
    - Free? Won't go away?
- [Keep it](http://reinventedsoftware.com/keepit/) (Mac + iOS)
    - Evernote alternative (iCloud + non subscription)
    - Good OCR, Ability clip pages as PDFs and web archives
- Apple Notes
    - Free? Quick access
- [IA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)
    - Focus 
    - Markdown
- Notion
    - Nesting, i.e., text in a table/cell can be another page
    - @" and "/" Commands 
- [Notability](https://www.gingerlabs.com/)
    - Handwriting + OCR
    - Audio recording - Great for sales meetings
- [Endless Paper](https://www.endlesspaper.app/)
    - A new tool, Endless canvas for writing on the iPad. Watch the video on the site 🤯
- Mac Folder
    - Store PDFs and Text in a Folder Search using Spotlight + iCloud Sync
- Google Docs
    - Collaboration, Comments to be more specific
- [NV Alt](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/)
    - Plain Text 
    - Search As the core interface
- Word
    - 🤦‍♂️
- Physical Paper
    - 👴

A rabbit hole if you want to go though a larger list :https://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors

## Jobs Note-taking does for me.

- Store (Secondary Storage)
    - Book highlights
    - Bills and receipts
    - Essential information like family prescriptions and medical history
- Content
    - Blogs, poems, quotes, etc
- Actual notes and work-related stuff
    - notes on this talk
    - Decks, blogs, etc. 
- Scratchpad

## My Needs

My search for a note-taking app had the following needs. 

- Evernote import capability ( I have been using it for 10 years now)
- The ability to export data, in case the tool was not "The One."
- The ability to record audio, write with my Apple Pencil, and scanning.
- Tagging and Search with OCR
    - This enabled my Storage job to be done.
- Syncing across my devices (Mac + iPhone + iPad)

I went down many rabbit holes, then sided with **simplicity**. If I took notes in text, I was never going to be locked down with an App. In an attempt to simplify I decided to give up on 

- Web & Android access to my notes
- Relax my need for having versions history

## My Current Stack

- [IA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) for writing & notes
- [Keep It](http://reinventedsoftware.com/keepit/) as a store of information 
- [Notability](https://www.gingerlabs.com/) for Handwriting 
- Playing around with [endless paper](https://www.endlesspaper.app/)
- Paper & Pen for real distraction-free work

## Personal Opinions

- You don't need to combine task management and note-taking, I think it is actually a net negative. You end up with an average tool that does many things. I am using Things for my task management 
- The links between the notes, unless manually added, add very little value for day to day notes or stored notes.
- Separate Note Taking from Information storage for additional simplification.
